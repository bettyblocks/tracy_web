Asset pipeline using `webpack@2` for `phoenix@1.3`.

# RTFM lazy programmer :D

Even when the setup is built for `phoenix@1.3` out of the box the build is easier to customize. You could fix the `OUTPUT_PATH` value in `webpack.config.js` file and everything should work as normal.

## What is inside?

  - Babel
  - Standard

  $ cd path/to/assets
  ```

2. Install the packages
